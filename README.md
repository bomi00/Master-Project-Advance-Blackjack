# Master-Project-Advance-Blackjack
**this was my final project in my course Python two from a company named "Juni Learning"**

this is game that uses numbers and cards names to play the game Blackjack. 
it first gives you two numbers to start off and you as the user get to decide if you would like to hit (adding another card to your deck) or stay (leaving your cards alone). 
If you choose to leave your cards alone it will now be the dealers turn to play the game. 
The first player to get to 21 or closest to 21 will win the game. 


I used an dictionary to identify the card names with their given values  
I used for loops to go through their deck to see if they exceed the maximum cards they should have  
I used if,elif, and else statements to check their given values to see if they have won or not
