# Master-Project-Advance-Blackjack
**this was my final project in my course Python two from a company named "Juni Learning"**

Its the computerized version of Blackjack. How the games goes is first they deal you two cards you either have a choice of either adding more cards or sticking with you current deck. The first person to get to 21 wins the game.
